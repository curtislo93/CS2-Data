# CS2 Data (Betting)

### This contains data from all the Major & International LAN events since the update to Counterstrike 2.

The main purpose of this is to analyze the data for an edge to betting on eSports. 
All game data taken from HLTV.org manually and all odds are the average (historical) odds found on Oddsportal.

Currently the model only tracks the higher stakes tournaments and events. 
The output of the model is to track whether or not the underdog has an edge in any 3 map matches, on the comeback or on the moneyline.
